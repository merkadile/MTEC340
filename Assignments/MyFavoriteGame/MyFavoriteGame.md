# My Favorite Game is Celeste.

I love Celeste because it's a platformer, and platformers are my favorite genre of game. What's really unique about Celeste though is that it's a platformer with a substantial plot that's more than just "make it to the end to stop bad guy" or "save the princess", which is rare for the genre. It's a story with characters that are nuanced and have their own motivations and character arcs and it's amazing. Additionally, the game's controls and moveset are really fun to work with, and allows for some incredibly well designed levels that are super challenging but always fair.

The game was made by [Maddy Makes Games](https://www.mattmakesgames.com/), a company that has now rebranded to [Extremely Ok Games](https://exok.com/)
The game was released on January 25th, 2018.
The game was made using the engine MonoGame.
